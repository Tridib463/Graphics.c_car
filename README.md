ðŸš— Exciting News! My Graphics Programming Project: Bringing a Car to Life on the Digital Road! ðŸŒž

During my 2nd semester in college, I had the opportunity to delve into the world of graphics programming, and I'm thrilled to share one of my most memorable projects with you all!



Using the power of C programming and the graphics.h library, I embarked on a journey to bring a dynamic scene to life on the screen. The challenge? Designing and implementing a digital environment where a car smoothly traverses a road against a sunny backdrop.



ðŸ’» The Execution:

With a combination of creativity and coding prowess, I brought this vision to reality using graphics.h in C programming. Leveraging fundamental concepts like drawing shapes, handling animations, and managing user input, I meticulously crafted every aspect of the scene to ensure a seamless and immersive experience.
